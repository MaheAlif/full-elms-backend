## üö® Frontend Issue - "Assignment not found" Fix

The backend is working correctly (API returns 200), but the frontend shows "Assignment not found". Here's how to fix it:

### Step 1: Update Database Schema (REQUIRED)
Run this SQL in phpMyAdmin:

```sql
USE elms;

-- Add missing columns for grading functionality
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN feedback TEXT;
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN graded_at DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN graded_by BIGINT;

-- Add foreign key for graded_by (optional)
ALTER TABLE submissions ADD FOREIGN KEY (graded_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

### Step 2: Debug Frontend (Check browser console)
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click "View Submissions" button
4. Check the API response for `/api/teacher/assignments/13/submissions`

### Step 3: Verify Teacher-Course Association
Run this query in phpMyAdmin to check if teacher has access to assignment 13:

```sql
SELECT 
    u.id as teacher_id,
    u.name as teacher_name,
    c.id as course_id,
    c.title as course_name,
    a.id as assignment_id,
    a.title as assignment_title
FROM users u
JOIN courses c ON u.id = c.teacher_id
JOIN sections s ON c.id = s.course_id
JOIN assignments a ON s.id = a.section_id
WHERE u.role = 'teacher' AND a.id = 13;
```

### Current Status:
‚úÖ Backend API working (returns 200)
‚úÖ Authentication working (teacher logged in)
‚ùå Frontend not displaying data (likely data parsing issue)

The issue is most likely that the database is missing the `feedback`, `graded_at`, and `graded_by` columns that the API is trying to query.
