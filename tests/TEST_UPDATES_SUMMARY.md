# Selenium Test Updates Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed CSS Selector Issues**
- Replaced invalid `:has-text()` pseudo-selectors with proper XPath expressions
- Changed multiple selectors in single CSS string to sequential try-catch blocks
- Fixed all element selection issues that were causing "InvalidSelectorError"

### 2. **Improved Class Chat Functionality**
- Enhanced input field detection with multiple fallback strategies
- Added JavaScript-based click and focus for better reliability
- Implemented Enter key fallback if send button is not found
- Added scroll-to-element functionality to ensure visibility

### 3. **AI Chat Step Removed**
- Removed AI chat interaction step as per requirements
- Test now focuses on core student workflow features only

### 4. **Professional Console Output**
- Removed all emoji characters (‚úÖ ‚ùå üéØ üìß etc.)
- Removed decorative box drawing characters (‚ïî‚ïê‚ïó ‚ïë ‚ïö‚ïù)
- Removed repeated equal signs (===)
- Simplified all console messages to plain text
- Clean, professional output suitable for automated testing reports

### 5. **Data Collection Enhanced**
Test now collects and reports:
- Selected course name
- Materials count
- Assignments count
- Calendar events count
- Chat message sent status

### 6. **Professional Report Generation**
Created `test-report-generator.js` that generates:
- **HTML Report** - Beautiful, interactive web report with styling
- **JSON Report** - Structured data for programmatic access
- **Markdown Report** - Documentation-friendly format
- **CSV Report** - Spreadsheet-compatible format

### 7. **Test Configuration**
```javascript
{
  FRONTEND_URL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  BACKEND_URL: 'http://localhost:5000',
  STUDENT_EMAIL: 'sakib221131@bscse.uiu.ac.bd',
  STUDENT_PASSWORD: 'password123',
  TIMEOUT: 5000,
  SCREENSHOT_DIR: './test-screenshots'
}
```

## Key Improvements

### Before
- Unreliable element selection causing test failures
- Decorative characters making logs hard to parse
- No structured data collection
- No professional reporting
- AI chat causing unnecessary failures

### After
- Robust element selection with multiple fallbacks
- Clean, parseable console output
- Comprehensive data collection
