# Final Fix: Assignments Tab Click

## The Missing Piece

### Problem
The assignments were not being detected because they are in a **separate tab** that needs to be clicked first, similar to how Calendar and Class Chat work.

### Previous Approach (WRONG)
```javascript
// Was looking for assignments section directly in the page
const assignmentsSection = await driver.findElements(
  By.xpath('//h2[contains(text(), "Assignments")]')
);
```

This assumed assignments were visible on the same page as materials, but they're actually in a separate tab!

### New Approach (CORRECT)
```javascript
// STEP 1: Click the Assignments tab first
const assignmentsTab = await driver.findElement(
  By.xpath('//button[contains(text(), "Assignments") or contains(text(), "Assignment")]')
);
await assignmentsTab.click();
console.log('   Assignments tab clicked');
await driver.sleep(2000); // Wait for assignments to load

// STEP 2: Now find assignment cards
const assignmentCards = await driver.findElements(
  By.xpath('//div[contains(@class, "glassmorphic") and (contains(., "Due") or contains(., "Submit"))]')
);
```

## Tab Structure in Course View

The course detail page has multiple tabs:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Course: CSE-4101                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Materials] [Assignments] [Calendar] [Chat]│  <-- TABS
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│  Content area (shows based on active tab)   │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Test Flow Now Clicks Each Tab:

1. **Step 6**: Materials tab (default/already active) - Download materials
2. **Step 7**: Click **Assignments tab** → View assignments
3. **Step 8**: Click **Calendar tab** → Hover October 30
4. **Step 9**: Click **Class Chat tab** → Send "test" message

## Complete Step 7 Logic

```javascript
// ============================================================
// STEP 7: View Assignments and Check Submission Status
// ============================================================
logStep(7, 'View assignments and check submission status');

try {
  // 1. Click on the Assignments tab
  const assignmentsTab = await driver.findElement(
    By.xpath('//button[contains(text(), "Assignments") or contains(text(), "Assignment")]')
  );
  await assignmentsTab.click();
  console.log('   Assignments tab clicked');
  await driver.sleep(2000); // Wait for assignments to load
  
  // 2. Scroll to see all assignments
  await driver.executeScript('window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight / 2)');
  await driver.sleep(1000);
  
  // 3. Find assignment cards
  let assignmentCards = await driver.findElements(
    By.xpath('//div[contains(@class, "glassmorphic") and (contains(., "Due") or contains(., "Assignment"))]')
  );
  
  console.log(`   Total assignment cards found: ${assignmentCards.length}`);
  
  // 4. Check each assignment for submission status
  for (let i = 0; i < assignmentCards.length; i++) {
    const cardText = await assignmentCards[i].getText();
    const lines = cardText.split('\n');
    const assignmentName = lines[0];
    
    // Detect submission status
    const isSubmitted = cardText.includes('Submitted') || 
                       cardText.includes('Grade:') || 
                       cardText.includes('Graded');
    const isPending = cardText.includes('Pending') || 
                     cardText.includes('Not Submitted') || 
                     cardText.includes('Submit Assignment');
    
    const status = isSubmitted ? 'Submitted' : (isPending ? 'Not Submitted' : 'Unknown');
    
    testResults.collectedData.assignmentsData.push({
      name: assignmentName,
      status: status
    });
    
    console.log(`   Assignment found: ${assignmentName} - ${status}`);
  }
} catch (e) {
  console.log(`   Could not access assignments: ${e.message}`);
}
```
