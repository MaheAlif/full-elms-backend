## Known Issues & Recommendations

### 1. **Class Chat Input Not Found**
**Issue:** The test cannot locate the chat input field.

**Possible Causes:**
- Chat input is in a shadow DOM
- Input is dynamically loaded after tab click
- Input has unique class or structure not covered by selectors

**Recommendations:**
- Inspect the Class Chat UI element structure
- Add `data-testid` attributes to chat input
- Increase wait time after tab click
- Check if Socket.IO needs to connect first

### 2. **Calendar October 30 Not Found**
**Issue:** Could not locate October 30 on the calendar.

**Possible Causes:**
- Calendar is showing current date (October 19, 2025)
- Need to navigate to correct month
- Date button structure different than expected

**Recommendations:**
- Add month navigation logic
- Look for month selector
- Navigate forward if needed
- Add explicit date verification

### 3. **Material Download File Path**
**Issue:** Download triggered alert about file not found.

**Recommendation:**
- Ensure materials exist in uploads folder
- Check file path in database matches actual file location
- Handle download alerts gracefully

### 4. **No Assignments Found**
**Issue:** Selected course has no assignments.

**Recommendation:**
- Select a different course with assignments
- Or add test assignments to CSE-4101 course
- Test with Biology or DSA course instead

   // Add month navigation
   const nextMonthButton = await driver.findElement(By.css('[aria-label="Next month"]'));
   await nextMonthButton.click();
   ```

3. **Test with Different Course:**
   ```javascript
   // Look for courses with assignments
   if (cardText.includes('Biology') || cardText.includes('DSA')) {
     await card.click();
   }
   ```
