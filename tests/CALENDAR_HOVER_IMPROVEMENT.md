# Calendar Hover Improvement - October 30, 2025

## The Issue
Events on October 30, 2025 appear only on **hover**, not on click. The previous logic wasn't detecting them properly.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Better Date Button Detection
```javascript
// Find all date buttons with "30"
let dateButtons = await driver.findElements(By.xpath('//button[contains(text(), "30")]'));
console.log(`   Found ${dateButtons.length} date buttons with "30"`);
```

### 2. More Detailed Logging
```javascript
// Log each button being checked
console.log(`   Checking date button ${i + 1}, classes: ${classList}`);

// Skip muted dates (previous/next month)
if (classList.includes('muted') || classList.includes('text-muted')) {
  console.log(`   Skipping muted/disabled date button ${i + 1}`);
  continue;
}
```

### 3. Proper Hover Action
```javascript
// Scroll to date button
await driver.executeScript('arguments[0].scrollIntoView({block: "center"})', dateBtn);
await driver.sleep(500);

// HOVER (not click!)
const actions = driver.actions({async: true});
await actions.move({origin: dateBtn}).perform();
console.log('   Hovering over October 30, 2025...');
await driver.sleep(2000); // Wait longer for tooltip to appear
```

### 4. Comprehensive Event Element Search
```javascript
// Look for various possible hover containers
let eventElements = await driver.findElements(By.xpath(
  '//div[contains(@class, "tooltip") or contains(@class, "popover") or contains(@class, "Popover") ' +
  'or contains(@class, "event") or contains(@class, "Event") ' +
  'or contains(@role, "tooltip") or contains(@class, "floating")]'
));

console.log(`   Found ${eventElements.length} potential event elements after hover`);
```

### 5. Filter Only Visible Events
```javascript
for (let j = 0; j < eventElements.length; j++) {
  const isDisplayed = await eventElements[j].isDisplayed();
  if (!isDisplayed) {
    console.log(`   Event element ${j + 1} not visible, skipping`);
    continue;
  }
  
  const eventText = await eventElements[j].getText();
  console.log(`   Event element ${j + 1} text: "${eventText}"`);
  
  if (eventText && eventText.trim().length > 3) {
    // Collect this event
    testResults.collectedData.calendarEvents.push({
      date: 'October 30, 2025',
      title: eventLines[0] || 'Event',
      details: eventText
    });
    eventsFound++;
    console.log(`   Event collected: ${eventLines[0]}`);
  }
}
```

### 6. Track Success
```javascript
if (eventsFound > 0) {
  console.log(`   Successfully found ${eventsFound} events on October 30`);
  break; // Found events, stop checking other "30" buttons
} else {
  console.log('   No visible events found on this date button, trying next...');
}
```

## Expected Console Output

### When Events Are Found:
```
[Step 8] Select calendar and check events on October 30, 2025
   Calendar tab clicked
   Looking for October 30, 2025 on calendar...
   Found 3 date buttons with "30"
   Checking date button 1, classes: text-muted opacity-40
   Skipping muted/disabled date button 1
   Checking date button 2, classes: hover:bg-accent
   Found active date button for 30, attempting hover...
   Hovering over October 30, 2025...
   Found 2 potential event elements after hover
   Event element 1 not visible, skipping
   Event element 2 text: "University Sports Day
   All students invited
   9:00 AM - 5:00 PM"
   Event collected: University Sports Day
   Successfully found 1 events on October 30
   Screenshot saved: 08_calendar_october30.png
   Status: SUCCESS - Events on October 30: 1
```

### When No Events Found:
```
[Step 8] Select calendar and check events on October 30, 2025
   Calendar tab clicked
   Looking for October 30, 2025 on calendar...
   Found 2 date buttons with "30"
   Checking date button 1, classes: text-muted
   Skipping muted/disabled date button 1
   Checking date button 2, classes: hover:bg-accent
   Found active date button for 30, attempting hover...
   Hovering over October 30, 2025...
   Found 0 potential event elements after hover
   October 30 found but no events detected on hover

```

## Key Changes

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Wait time | 1500ms | 2000ms (longer for tooltip) |
| Event search | Simple class check | Multiple patterns (tooltip, popover, floating, role) |
| Logging | Basic | Detailed per-button analysis |
| Button detection | Exact text match | Contains text (more flexible) |
| Visibility check | Basic | Explicit isDisplayed() check with logging |
| Event text logging | Only final | Shows each element's text for debugging |

## How to Test

1. Ensure there's an event on October 30, 2025 in the database
2. Run the test: `node selenium-student-full-workflow.js`
3. Check console output for detailed hover logs
4. Review screenshot `08_calendar_october30.png` to see hover state

## Troubleshooting

If events still not found:

1. **Check the screenshot** - Is the hover tooltip visible?
2. **Check console logs** - How many event elements were found?
3. **Inspect the UI** - What HTML element contains the events on hover?
4. **Add more patterns** - Update the XPath to include the actual class name

Example:
```javascript
// If events are in a div with class "calendar-tooltip"
let eventElements = await driver.findElements(By.xpath(
  '//div[contains(@class, "calendar-tooltip") or contains(@class, "tooltip") ...]'
));
```
